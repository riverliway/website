# River's Portfolio Website
To publish: `npm run prod`.

The repo's `/compiled/index.html` only needs to be updated in the host if the headers get changed, which is rare. But if it gets changed, or a new subroute gets added, then it needs to get placed in every hosted's `<route>/index.html`  and `/index.html`

Then copy the repo's `/compiled/main.*` into the hosted's `/assets/main.*`.
