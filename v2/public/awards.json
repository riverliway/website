  "description": "QILCOM is the Quantum Ideas Lab Competition hosted by Stevens Institute of Technology. It is a research competition where teams of undergraduates are paired up with a PhD student to perform experiments and conduct research in the field of quantum computing.\n\nMy team attempted to find a state estimation algorithm which could approximate the resulting state of certain types of quantum circuits more efficiently. Simulating general quantum circuits is extremely expensive in time and space complexity, so our algorithm could dramatically reduce that time for specific types of quantum circuits by sacrificing a bit of accuracy. Although it fails to efficiently simulate circuits like Grover's search or Shor's factoring algorithm, it can offer improvement against Google's Random Circuit Sampling problem."
